# Siyang's data analysis and data science portfolios

Welcome to my github page! My name is Siyang Cai. I'm a reasearcher in Leicester University working in the area of data analysis and data sciecne of summary statistics from genome-wide association studies (GWAS). This is a list of my personal data analysis and data science projects as my portfolio.

## [Project 1: Cyclistic Case Study from Google Data Analytics Professional Course](https://siyangcai.github.io/Cyclistic/)
This is a capstone project from Google Data Analytics Professional Course, which aims to figure out user behaviour with/without membership using data from a bike-sharing company Cyclistic in 2021. The main achievements are:
* visualizations of the data in weekly and monthly form between casual and annual members,
* discovery of different using patterns between casual and annual members,
* Four possible solutions are designed to help increase membership subscriptions.

## [Project 2: Monkeypox data analysis](https://siyangcai.github.io/Monkeypox/)
Monkeypox has become one of the most serious pandemic since early 2022. This project aims to analyse the data from Global Health team to summarize important features in the spread of Monkeypox. I have successfully found:
* the approximate start time of Monkeypox and the trend in number of confirmations,
* the top countries with most cases displayed with a global heatmap,
* the top countries metioned by confirmed cases in their travel history,
* the most common symptoms of Monkeypox.

## [Project 3: Classification on poisonous and edible mushrooms](https://siyangcai.github.io/ML-mushroom-classification/)
This project aims to build machine learning models to help classify mushrooms between poisonous or eidble, which used a dataset contains hypothetical samples corresponding to 23 species of gilled mushrooms in the Agaricus and Lepiota Family Mushroom drawn from The Audubon Society Field Guide to North American Mushrooms. The main achievements are:
* comparing results from Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM classifier) and a Voting classifer in scikit-learn,
* cross validation to avoid random effects on the whole pipeline of preprocessing and ML model,
* parameter tuning to find the best parameters with best accuracy,
* obtain best accuracy of 98.35% in identify poisonous mushrooms.

## [Project 4: House price prediction](https://siyangcai.github.io/House_price_prediction/)
This project aims to predict house prices by using machine learning models from a dataset that includes sale prices for King County in US in 2015. The main achievements in this project are:
* data cleaning to find some interesting information in the dataset and remove those that are unreasonable,
* feature engineering to create more feautres that better describe the sale prices,
* comparing results from Random Forest, Linear Regression, Lasso Regression and XGBoost, with cross validation.
* using parameter tuning if necessary,
* the best model is between Random Forest and XGBboost with a `R2` score as 0.99 

## [Project 5: Classification on images of car or trucks using CNN](https://siyangcai.github.io/car-or-truck/)
This is a classical deep learning project aiming to classify car and truck images using convolutional neural network. I have constructed a deep learning model with 3 CNN layers with data augments, followed by a training process with 80 epochs. I have not observed signs of over-fitting or under-fitting. An satisfying accuracy of 88.84% is then obtained.
